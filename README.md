# Coded Excitation
This repository provides basic source code in MATLAB to implement compound Barker coded excitation with inverse 
filtering for ultrasound imaging. An example script demonstrates basic usage of the functions. In addition, a function 
to generate the pulse code description of a tri-state coded excitation waveform is provided for programming the 
transmit waveform of the Verasonics Vantage system. No Verasonics code itself is provided. This repository accompanies 
an article described below.
